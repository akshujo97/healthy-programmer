# healthy-programmer

We know the life as a programmer can be very intense as we have no activity while we spend away our time on screen half of the day (quite literally). 

Thanks to python's time and pygame module we can create alerts to alert ourselves to do some sort of activity while we're working. I created this code all bymyself and this will help all the programmers out there to keep them active. 

## Requirements - 

You will need to import following things - 
1. mixer from pygame module
2. datetime from datetime module
3. time

This will also create and write the datestamp at what time and date you did what activity in a file format

Also if two timings of the activity collide then the program will take care of that too.
Hope you will like it
